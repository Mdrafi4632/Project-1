## Notes
**Challenges Encountered While Building the App**

**Image Loading Issues:**
- Imgur links were not working on GitHub.
- Fixed by using direct image URLs or hosting images in the repository.

**Responsive Layout Problems:**
- Cards were misaligned on small screens.
- I used CSS Grid instead of Flexbox for better alignment.

**Broken Images:**
- Some coffee shop images were missing.
- Implemented a fallback image when an image fails to load.

**Performance Optimization:**
- Large images slowed down loading.
- Used lazy loading (loading="lazy") and optimized file sizes.

**Search Bar Functionality:**
The search feature is currently a placeholder.
- We plan to add dynamic filtering for coffee shop searches.

**Deployment Issues:**
- Some assets were not displaying on GitHub Pages/Vercel.
- Fixed by using correct relative image paths.
